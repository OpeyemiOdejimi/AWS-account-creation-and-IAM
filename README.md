### What is cloud?
You can Imagine your computer or phone. It stores all your pictures, files, and apps, right? But what if you run out of space or lose your device? That's where the cloud comes in. The cloud is like a giant digital storage space, but it's not just one big hard drive sitting somewhere. It's actually made up of lots of powerful computers connected over the internet. These computers store and manage all your stuff securely.

it is like having a magical backpack that holds all your stuff, and you can access it whenever you need, no matter where you are.

So instead of keeping everything on your device, you can store it in the cloud. This means you can access your files, photos, and even apps from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.

### What is AWS Cloud?
There are many cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud, each offering a range of services for businesses and individuals. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud providers in the market, providing a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services.

It offers a vast array of computing resources, including servers, storage, databases, networking, and more, all delivered over the internet. It's like a huge digital world where companies and people can use really strong computers without having to invest in physical hardware.

Note- A cloud provider is a company that offers online storage and computing services. They let you store your data and run your apps on their powerful computers, which you can access over the internet.

### Importance of AWS Cloud
The AWS Cloud is important because it lets businesses and individuals do things that were once only possible for big companies with lots of money. Now, even small businesses and startups can access the same powerful tools and technology to build, grow, and scale their ideas.

Example - If you're starting a new business, and you need a computer, some memory (RAM), storage space (like a hard disk), and a fast processor (CPU) to run your new app. But here's the tricky part: you're not sure if your business will take off, if lots of people will use your app, or if it'll just be a small project.

Instead of buying all those resources upfront, which could cost a ton of money, you can think of AWS like a big rental store for digital stuff. You only take what you need right now, and you pay for it as you use it. So if your app suddenly gets really popular and needs more resources, you can easily get them from AWS without breaking the bank. And if things slow down, you can scale back and pay less because it works on Pay As You Go model.

> Note- In the "pay as you go" model of AWS, you're charged for the services you use, like storing data or running a website. If you use more, you pay more; if you use less, you pay less. This way, you only pay for what you actually use, making it flexible and cost-effective for businesses.

# Introduction to Cloud Computing – Security & Identity Management (IAM)

This mini project is designed to guide you through the intricacies of Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM). Before diving into the specifics of IAM, it’s crucial to establish that a basic understanding of cloud computing principles is a prerequisite for this project. If you’re hearing about "Cloud" for the first time, it would mean that you have not followed the program so far, so it is highly recommended that you go back to the start of this program to learn about the cloud.

As a recap, it involves delivering computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

In this project, we will be working with a hypothetical fintech startup named Zappy e-Bank. This fictitious company represents a typical startup venturing into the financial technology sector, aiming to leverage the cloud's power to innovate, scale, and deliver financial services. The scenario is set up to provide a realistic backdrop that will help you understand the application of AWS IAM in managing cloud resources securely and efficiently.

## The Importance of IAM for Zappy e-Bank
For Zappy e-Bank, like any company dealing with financial services, security and compliance are paramount. The company must ensure that its data, including sensitive customer information, is securely managed and that access to resources is tightly controlled. AWS IAM plays a critical role in achieving these security objectives by allowing the company to define who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

**IAM will enable Zappy e-Bank to:**
Create and manage AWS users and groups, to control access to AWS services and resources securely.
Use IAM roles and policies to set more granular permissions for AWS services and external users or services that need to access Zappy e-Bank' AWS resources.
Implement strong access controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to enhance security.
This project will walk you through setting up IAM for Zappy e-Bank, creating a secure environment that reflects real-world usage and challenges. Through this hands-on experience, you will learn the fundamentals of IAM, how to manage access to AWS resources, and best practices for securing your cloud environment.

## Project Goals and Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have:

Gained a solid understanding of AWS IAM, including users, groups, roles, and policies.
Learned how to apply IAM concepts to secure a fintech startup’s cloud infrastructure.
Developed practical skills in using the AWS Management Console to manage IAM.
Understood the significance of secure access management and its impact on compliance and data security in the fintech industry.
Project Setup
Log in to the AWS Management Console: Use your administrator account to log in.

Navigate to the IAM Dashboard: Here, you'll manage users, groups, roles, and policies.

## Excercises:
### Creating IAM Users
An IAM user is a unique identity within an AWS account that represents a person or service, granting specific permissions to access and interact with AWS resources under controlled and customizable security policies.

Imagine that you have a big, secure building (AWS account) that you own and control. When you first get the keys to this building, you're given a master key (root user) that can open every door, access every floor, and make changes to the building's structure itself.

This master key is powerful, allowing you to do anything from adding new rooms (services) to changing the locks (security settings). However, because this key can do so much, it's also very risky to use it for daily tasks—like if you lost it, someone could do anything they want with your building.

Now, imagine you have specific tasks that need to be done in the building, like cleaning, maintenance, or security checks. You wouldn't give out your master key to every person who needs to do those jobs. Instead, you create specific keys (IAM users) that can only open certain doors or access certain floors. These keys are less powerful but much safer to use for everyday tasks. They ensure that the people holding them can only access the parts of the building they need to do their jobs and nothing more.

Let's set up IAM users for a backend developer, John, and a data analyst, Mary, by first determining their specific access needs.

As a backend developer, John requires access to servers (EC2) to run his code, necessitating an IAM user with policies granting EC2 access.

As a data analyst, Mary needs access to data storage (AWS S3 service), so her IAM user should have policies enabling S3 access.

Considering Zappy e-Bank's plan to expand its team with 10 more developers and 5 additional data analysts in the coming months, it's inefficient to individually create similar policies for each new member. A more streamlined approach involves:

## Crafting a single policy tailored to each role's access requirements.
Associating this policy with a group specifically designed for that role.
Adding all engineers or analysts to their respective groups, simplifying the management of permissions and ensuring consistent access across the team.
Create policy for the Development team
In the IAM console, click on policies

Alt text

Click on create policy

Alt text

In the select a service section, search for ec2

Alt text

For simplicity sake, select the "All EC2 actions" checkbox

Alt text

Also, make sure to select "All" in the Resources section

Alt text

Click Next

Provide the name developers and description for the policy.Alt text

Click on Create Policy

Notice that after creating the policy, if you search for "developer" in the search box, you will notice that a number of policies are returned. This highlights the presence of both AWS managed and customer managed policies. AWS managed policies are predefined by AWS and provide permissions for many common use cases, allowing for quick and broad access management across AWS services without the need for custom policy creation like we just did. In contrast, customer managed policies are created and fully controlled by you, allowing for more tailored, specific access controls that can be finely tuned to your organization's requirements.

Alt text

### Create policy for the Data Analyst team
Repeat the process above for the Data Analysts team, but instead of EC2, search for S3. Also name the policy analyst instead of developers. You can give it any description of your choice.

### Create Group for the Development team
In the IAM console navigation, select User group and in the top right click Create group
Alt text

Provide an a name for the group
Alt text

Attach the developer policy we created earlier to the group. This will allow any user in the Development-Team group to have access to EC2 instances alone
Alt text

You have successfully created a group and attached a permission policy for any user added to the group to have access to the EC2 instance only. Recall that users in this group will be backend developers only.
Alt text

### Create Group for the Data Analysts team
Repeat the process above for the Data Analysts team.

i. The Group name should be Analyst-Team

ii. Instead of attaching developers policy, attach analyst policy.

Recall that you only allowed S3 access for this policy. So any user in this group will have access to S3 Service. In our case, our users will be the data analysts.

### Creating IAM User for John

Let's recall that John is a backend developer, therefore he need to be added as a user to the Development-Team group

Navigate to the IAM dashboard, select "Users" and then click "Create user".

Alt text

Review the highlights in the screenshot

Provide the name of the user. In this case "John"
Ensure that the user can access the AWS Management Console. If this is not selected, the user will not be able to login from the web browser.Alt text
Permissions: Add the John to the development team group.Alt text

Click on Create user

Alt text

Download the login credentials for John
Alt text

### Creating IAM User for Mary

Repeat the same step for Mary. But recall that Mary is a Data analyst, which means she need to be added as a user to the Analyst-Team group

Testing and Validation
Testing John's Access

Login as John: Use the credentials provided to John to log into the AWS Management Console. This simulates John's user experience and ensures he has the correct access.

Access EC2 Dashboard: Navigate to the EC2 dashboard within the AWS Management Console. John should be able to view, launch, and manage EC2 instances as his role requires access to servers for deploying and managing backend applications.

Perform EC2 Actions: Attempt to create a new EC2 instance or modify an existing one to confirm that John has the necessary permissions. If John can successfully perform these actions, it indicates his IAM user has been correctly set up with the appropriate policies for a backend developer.

Testing Mary's Access

Login as Mary: Use the credentials provided to Mary to log into the AWS Management Console. This ensures that Mary's user experience is as expected and that she has the correct access.

Access S3 Dashboard: Navigate to the S3 dashboard within the AWS Management Console. Mary should be able to view, create, and manage S3 buckets as her role requires access to data storage for analyzing and managing data.

Perform S3 Actions: Try to create a new S3 bucket or upload data to an existing bucket to verify that Mary has the necessary permissions. Successful execution of these tasks will confirm that Mary's IAM user has been properly set up with the appropriate policies for a data analyst.

Validating Group Policies

For both users, ensure that their access is confined to their role-specific resources (EC2 for John and S3 for Mary) and that they cannot access other AWS services beyond what their group policies permit. This validation ensures adherence to the principle of least privilege, enhancing security by limiting access to only what is necessary for each user's role.

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Now that you have created a new users. Let's create Multi-Factor Authentication for John. But before we to that, what is MFA ?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS account and resources. With MFA enabled, users are required to provide two or more forms of authentication before they can access AWS resources.

John, the backend developer, logs into the AWS Management Console to access EC2 instances for deploying and testing his code. However, to further secure his access, Zappy e-Bank requires John to use MFA in addition to his regular username and password.

When John attempts to log in, after providing his username and password, AWS prompts him to enter a one-time code generated by an MFA device.

Setting Up MFA for John
CLick on User and then click on john. It is assumed we already created a user account for johnAlt text

Click on enable MFA as shown in the image belowAlt text

Enter a device name for john MFA and select authenticator appAlt text

Note: You should install authenticator app like Google authenticator or microsoft authenticator on your mobile device if you don't have it installed.

Click on Next

Open your Google authenticator or microsoft authenticator application on your mobile device to scan the QR Code, then you can fill in the 2 consecutive codes as shown in the image belowAlt text

By completing step 1-5, MFA will be enabled for johnAlt text

### Setting Up MFA for Mary
Repeat the same step for Mary
